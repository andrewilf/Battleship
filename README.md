**Note: For best experience, play it on Google Chrome, other browsers may have slight graphical or audio glitches**  
This project was made during a Software Engineering Immersive course by General Assembly. This was the first project during the course and is quite rough in its design, with plenty of "janky" design choices.

Should I ever wish to revisit this project, it would likely need to be rebuilt from scratch on a game engine. However feel free to branch the code if for some reason you wish to improve it.

## Game Rules

Battleship is a turn-based game where two players are trying to sink the opposing player's fleet. Each player has five ships in their fleet of varying sizes and willl take turns to target coordinates on the opponent's board.

- You start the game by placing your five ships on your grid to the left. Use the mouse wheel to rotate the ship 90 degrees.
- After all the ships are placed, you can click a tile on your opponent's grid to start the attack. If you miss, it will be your opponent's turn.
- You cannot attack a coordinate which has already been attacked.
- Any time a player hits a segment of an opposing ship, they get to attack again. 
- A ship is sunk when all parts of it have been hit by the opponent.
- The game continues until one player has sunk all five ships on the opposite side.

The opponent was programmed to attack randomly. Play on a higher difficulty to up the challenge.

| Difficulty |  Player   |    Opponent |
| ---------- | :-------: | ----------: |
| Easy       | 8x8 board |   7x7 board |
| Medium     | 7x7 board |   9x9 board |
| Hard       | 6x6 board | 10x10 board |

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- JQueryUI

## Areas to improve on/wish list:

- Clean up class declarations
- Use WebAudioAPI rather than Audio objects for better audio control
- Preload all the fx and img assets at the start
- Improve the CSS to work on multiple monitor sizes
- Increase sensitivity of the function for rotating ships
- Better "About" page
- Give ship sprites with a front, middle, and back segment
- Create a harder AI which attacks around areas they have landed successful hits
- ~~better audio mixing~~
- Implement different game modes
- Implement an options menu
- Hard code less aspects of the game
- Implement a button to rotate ships while placing them. Currently they can only be rotated by the mouse wheel making it impossible if played on mobile

## Patch Notes:

v 1.1: 
- Audio edited to not destroy your eardrums if playing with headphones
- "Interlude" version of the BGM plays while in the "ship placing" phase of the game
