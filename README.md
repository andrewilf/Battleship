# Battleship
Battleship game v 1.1

Play game here: https://andrewilf.github.io/Battleship/

Battleship is a turn based game where two players are trying to sink the opposing players fleet. Each player has 5 ships in their fleet of varying sizes and take turns to targets coordinates on the opponents board. Any time a player hits a segment of an opposing ship, they get to attack again. A ship is sunk when all parts of it have been hit by the opponent.

Most of the visual features of this game were done with mostly vanilla javaScript and JQuery.
