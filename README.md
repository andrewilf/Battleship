Battleship is a turn based game where two players are trying to sink the opposing players fleet. Each player has 5 ships in their fleet of varying sizes and take turns to targets coordinates on the opponents board. Any time a player hit a segment of an opposing ship, they get to attack again. A ship is sunk when all parts of it have been hit by the opponent.

# Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- JQueryUI

# Areas to improve on:
- A lot of redundant code to be removed
- Clean up class declarations
- Use WebAudioAPI rather than Audio objects for better audio control
- Preload all the fx and img assets at the start for better performance
- Improve the CSS to work on multiple monitor sizes
- Hard code less aspects of the game

# Feature wish list:
- front, middle, rear images to place for ship
- harder AI
- better audio mixing
- Have different game modes
- Have an options menu using modal
- Better art assets (though its pretty economical as it is)
- Fix the errors which appear for the gh page version of the game
